		    	<p><h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>This file is a digitized version of  a card-file index of approximately 20,000 images and text of descriptions of  fossil plant species, maintained at Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History as a  classification and identification tool. The Compendium Index presently covers  fossil floras from North America, including Greenland, starting in the Triassic  Period and extending to Pleistocene. In some cases its coverage is extended to higher  latitude regions of Eurasia because of the close relationship of the entire  circumpolar flora of those times. Each record in the physical Compendium  consists of an 8"x10" card onto which the illustrations and description of an  individual occurrence of a fossil plant species have been reproduced on the  front and reverse side, respectively. Along with the illustration, the front of  the card also contains the species name, its geological age, the formation  where it occurs, its status, as well as its locality of occurrence and the  citation of the reference where it was published (see user guide). Each entry thus  must consist of at least two images-a front and a back-that together make up  the primary card. For many entries, there are also secondary cards, which  consist of additional illustrations or text. </p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p>The taxonomic identification of fossil plant material is an essential first step in determining the evolutionary history of plant lineages. Geologists, paleontologists, climatologists, and, to an increasing extent, those involved in the phylogenetic reconstruction of plant lineages depend on accurate identifications. Fossil plant data are essential for reconstructing the history of vegetation and patterns of continental drift, as well as for inferring the environmental and climatic changes that have affected the land surface of the earth over geological time.</p>     
		         <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p>Yet the identification of a fossil species and determination of its novelty is often a painstaking process that may consume months of research time. In order to determine the correct name for a fossil plant, researchers must examine a broad array of publications from highly disparate and often hard to obtain sources that span a period of more than 160 years. Moreover, the large number of misidentifications, synonyms, and misapplied names in the systematic literature require that researchers obtain access to high quality pictorial data in addition to lists of names and occurrences. Despite recent advances in digitization of such material, the scattered nature and lack of systematic finding-aides to this literature often cause investigators to overlook important primary sources.</p>

		    	<h2>History</h2>
		        <p>In 1937 Erling Dorf, of the Department of  Geology at Princeton University, began to compile what he titled the <em>Compendium Index of North American Mesozoic  and Cenozoic Type Fossil Plants</em>. By 1940, he had amassed some 126  references (Dorf, 1940). One of his goals was to optimize the coverage of the  early systematic literature of paleobotany because of its significance in  determining the senior appellations in taxonomic identifications. In addition,  Dorf greatly facilitated identification of fossil plants by the innovative way  in which he organized the cards of the Compendium. This innovation was the  arrangement of the cards into a set of numbered morphological categories (e.g.,  leaf shape, major venation type) that grouped like forms with one another  regardless of their purported taxonomic assignments. During the period when  Erling Dorf compiled the Compendium, clippings of the original references were glued  directly on to the cards. If clippings could not be obtained, photographs were  made of the figures and the descriptions from library copies were typed  directly on the card stock.</p>
		        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		        <p>The Compendium was transferred to the Paleobotany Division in the Peabody Museum of Natural History in 1984.  And work immediately began on updating the content and reorganizing the classification system.  At first, most new references were added using paste-ups of high quality Xerox copies. Today, new cards are made by means of Photoshop and physical copies of new cards are still prepared but these consist entirely of digital scans of images and text. Work on the Compendium remains an ongoing project of the Division of Paleobotany. </p>

				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				<p>Each of the files  in this data base consists of a digital image of a physical card that was  produced sometime during a period of over 70 years. The early cards consist of  paste-ups made from clippings of the original literature and are sometimes  stained by the deterioration of the original glues that were used. Early cards  may bear images belonging to more than one CIC, such as a fruit and a leaf on  the same card, although the current editors have made every effort to  cross-reference these into their appropriate categories.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Entries bear the  identifications applied by their original authors. The editors have made no  effort to synonomize these or apply more modern concepts of systematics,  although spelling errors are sometimes corrected and hand-written notes and  corrections by later authorities may appear on some cards.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Copyright permission has been secured for all of the images used in this compendium and the cooperating owners are acknowledged below. In cases where copyright permission could not be secured, the relevant pictures and text are masked, with a reference given to the original source.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Finally, in a  compilation of such size, mistakes and omissions are inevitable. Hopefully,  many of the most egregious have been corrected but others no doubt remain  because of the need to publish this work in a timely fashion. The editors would appreciate receiving  comments and corrections from the users through this website. They would also  value suggestions for further additions to the list of references.</p>
